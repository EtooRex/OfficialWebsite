# Getting Started with AEROS

Welcome to AEROS, the next-generation platform for engineering simulation and design optimization.

## What is AEROS?

AEROS is a comprehensive reliability engineering platform that combines advanced simulation capabilities with intuitive design tools. It's designed to help engineers make data-driven decisions about system design and operations.

## Core Products

### AeROS® (Asset Reliability and Operations Simulation)

Advanced RAM analysis tool specifically designed for heavy asset industries with features like:

- Reliability Block Diagrams for complex system modeling
- Monte Carlo Simulation for accurate predictions
- Life-Stress Models using cumulative damage theory
- Redundant Resource Manager for complex standby scenarios

### Weibull Toolbox®

Statistical analysis suite for failure characteristic modeling:

- Distribution fitting with multiple parameter estimation methods
- Probability plotting with confidence bounds
- Life data analysis for complete, censored, and interval data
- Reliability prediction including MTTF and failure rates

## Quick Start

1. **Choose Your Platform**: Desktop, Web, or Cloud
2. **Create Project**: Define your system architecture
3. **Input Data**: Add component failure data and maintenance parameters
4. **Run Analysis**: Configure simulation settings and execute
5. **Review Results**: Analyze availability, reliability, and optimization recommendations

## Best Practices

- Ensure data quality before analysis
- Start with simple models and add complexity gradually
- Validate results against engineering judgment
- Document assumptions and limitations
