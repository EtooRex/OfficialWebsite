## Data Classification Guide

Understanding different types of reliability data and their characteristics is crucial for proper analysis and decision-making in reliability engineering.

### Overview

Reliability data comes in various forms, each with specific characteristics that affect how it should be analyzed and interpreted. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of data classification in reliability engineering.

### Types of Reliability Data

#### Complete Data
Complete data represents observations where the exact failure time is known for all units in the study.

**Characteristics:**
- All failure times are observed
- No censoring present
- Provides the most information for analysis
- Ideal for parameter estimation

**Example:** Testing 100 components until all fail, recording each failure time.

#### Censored Data
Censored data occurs when the exact failure time is not observed for some units.

##### Right Censoring
The most common type of censoring in reliability studies.

**Characteristics:**
- Test ends before all units fail
- Some units are still functioning at test end
- We know the unit survived at least until the censoring time

**Example:** Testing components for 1000 hours, some still working at test end.

##### Left Censoring
Less common in reliability engineering.

**Characteristics:**
- Failure occurred before observation began
- We know failure happened before a certain time
- Common in warranty data analysis

##### Interval Censoring
Failure time is known to fall within an interval.

**Characteristics:**
- Exact failure time unknown
- Failure occurred between two inspection times
- Common in periodic inspection scenarios

#### Grouped Data
Data that has been organized into intervals or bins.

**Characteristics:**
- Individual failure times not available
- Data presented as counts within time intervals
- Requires special analysis techniques

### Data Quality Considerations

#### Sample Size
- **Small samples** (n < 30): Limited statistical power, wide confidence intervals
- **Large samples** (n > 100): Better parameter estimation, narrower confidence intervals

#### Data Completeness
- **Missing data**: Can bias results if not handled properly
- **Outliers**: May indicate different failure modes or data quality issues

#### Time Units
- Ensure consistent time units throughout analysis
- Consider appropriate time scales for the application

### Supported Distributions

| Distribution | Parameters | Use Cases |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Weibull | 2 & 3 Parameter | General reliability analysis |
| Exponential | 1 & 2 Parameter | Constant failure rate systems |
| Normal | Standard & Log | Wear-out failures |
| Gamma | 2 & 3 Parameter | Complex failure patterns |

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Import**: Load your failure data
2. **Distribution Fitting**: Fit multiple distributions
3. **Model Selection**: Choose best-fit distribution
4. **Parameter Estimation**: Calculate parameters with confidence intervals
5. **Reliability Prediction**: Generate reliability metrics
6. **Reporting**: Create professional analysis reports

## Analysis Implications

### Distribution Selection
Different data types may favor different statistical distributions:

- **Weibull**: Versatile, handles various failure patterns
- **Exponential**: Constant failure rate, memoryless property
- **Normal**: Wear-out failures, degradation processes
- **Lognormal**: Fatigue failures, multiplicative processes

### Parameter Estimation Methods
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: Most efficient for complete data
- **Probability Plotting**: Visual method, good for censored data
- **Moment Methods**: Simple but less efficient

## Best Practices

### Data Collection
1. **Plan data collection** strategy before testing
2. **Document test conditions** and environmental factors
3. **Record censoring reasons** (test end, withdrawal, etc.)
4. **Maintain data integrity** throughout collection process

### Data Preparation
1. **Clean and validate** data before analysis
2. **Check for outliers** and investigate causes
3. **Verify time units** and scaling factors
4. **Document assumptions** and limitations

### Analysis Approach
1. **Start with exploratory** data analysis
2. **Consider multiple distributions** for comparison
3. **Validate results** using goodness-of-fit tests
4. **Report confidence intervals** with point estimates

## Common Pitfalls

### Data Misclassification
- Treating censored data as complete failures
- Ignoring different failure modes in mixed data
- Inappropriate grouping of heterogeneous data

### Analysis Errors
