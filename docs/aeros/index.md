# AeROS® Documentation

AeROS® (Asset Reliability and Operations Simulation) is an advanced Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM) analysis tool specifically designed for the heavy asset industry.

## Overview

The heavy asset industry is defined by extremely high-value production, incredibly harsh operating environments, severe safety risks, and massive capital investments. Unplanned downtime can cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per day. RAM analysis is not just an engineering exercise here; it's a critical business and risk management tool.

## Key Features

### Advanced RAM Analysis
- System Design Comparison During Front-End Engineering Design (FEED)
- Identifying Bottlenecks Early
- Setting Realistic Performance Targets
- Optimizing Maintenance Strategies
- Managing Spare Parts Inventory
- Debottlenecking Production

### Reliability Block Diagrams
Create complex system models with series, parallel, and K-out-of-N configurations.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
Advanced simulation engine for accurate reliability and availability predictions.

### Maintenance Optimization
Model and optimize maintenance strategies for maximum asset performance.

### Complex Process Scenarios
Includes Redundant Resource Manager for complex standby scenarios.

### Life Stress Models
Features Life-Stress Models using cumulative damage theory to analyze production rate impacts.

### Advanced Plots
Delivers specialized plots: System Availability, System Flowrate, and Spare Availability.
