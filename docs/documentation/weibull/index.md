# Weibull Toolbox® Overview

Weibull Toolbox® is an advanced statistical analysis suite designed to evaluate and model the failure characteristics of products and systems using the Weibull distribution and other reliability distributions.

## What is Weibull Analysis?

The Weibull distribution is one of the most important and versatile distributions in reliability engineering. It can model:

- **Infant mortality** (β < 1): Early failures due to manufacturing defects
- **Random failures** (β = 1): Constant failure rate, exponential distribution
- **Wear-out failures** (β > 1): Increasing failure rate due to aging

## Key Features

### Distribution Fitting
- **Multiple estimation methods**: Maximum Likelihood, Method of Moments, Least Squares
- **Automatic method selection**: Choose the best method for your data
- **Goodness-of-fit testing**: Validate your distribution choice
- **Parameter confidence intervals**: Understand estimation uncertainty

### Probability Plotting
- **Professional plots**: Publication-ready Weibull probability plots
- **Confidence bounds**: Visualize parameter uncertainty
- **Multiple datasets**: Compare different populations on one plot
- **Custom formatting**: Tailor plots to your presentation needs

### Life Data Analysis
- **Complete data**: Analyze failure times directly
- **Right censored**: Handle suspended or ongoing tests
- **Left censored**: Analyze detection-limited data
- **Interval censored**: Handle inspection-based data

### Reliability Predictions
- **Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)**: Calculate expected life
- **Reliability functions**: R(t), F(t), f(t), h(t)
- **Warranty analysis**: Predict warranty returns
- **Mission reliability**: Calculate success probability
