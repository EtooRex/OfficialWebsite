# AeROS® Overview

AeROS® (Asset Reliability and Operations Simulation) is an advanced Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM) analysis tool specifically designed for the heavy asset industry.

## What is AeROS®?

The heavy asset industry is defined by:
- Extremely high-value production
- Incredibly harsh operating environments  
- Severe safety risks
- Massive capital investments

Unplanned downtime can cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per day. RAM analysis is not just an engineering exercise here; it's a critical business and risk management tool.

## Key Applications

### System Design Comparison (FEED)
During Front-End Engineering Design, AeROS® helps compare different system configurations to select the most reliable and cost-effective option.

### Bottleneck Identification
Identify potential reliability bottlenecks early in the design phase, before they become expensive problems in operation.

### Performance Target Setting
Set realistic and achievable performance targets based on rigorous analysis rather than guesswork.

### Maintenance Strategy Optimization
Optimize maintenance strategies to balance cost, availability, and safety requirements.

### Spare Parts Management
Determine optimal spare parts inventory levels to minimize costs while maintaining target availability.

### Production Debottlenecking
Identify and address production constraints to maximize throughput and efficiency.
