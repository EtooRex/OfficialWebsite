# AeROS® - Asset Reliability and Operations Simulation

AeROS® is an advanced Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM) analysis tool designed specifically for heavy asset industries.

## Overview

AeROS® extends beyond standard Reliability Block Diagram functionality with advanced logical constructs and specialized features for realistic simulations.

## Key Features

### Reliability Block Diagrams
- Series and parallel configurations
- K-out-of-N systems
- Complex sub-diagram structures
- Advanced logical constructs

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- High-performance simulation engine
- Accurate reliability predictions
- Availability calculations
- Maintainability analysis

### Life Stress Models
- Cumulative damage theory
- Production rate impact analysis
- Realistic operating conditions
- Environmental factor modeling

## Use Cases

AeROS® is particularly valuable for:

- **System Design Comparison** during Front-End Engineering Design (FEED)
- **Bottleneck Identification** early in the design phase
- **Performance Target Setting** with realistic expectations
- **Maintenance Strategy Optimization**
- **Spare Parts Inventory Management**
- **Production Debottlenecking**

## Getting Started

1. Create a new AeROS® project
2. Define your system architecture
3. Input component reliability data
4. Configure simulation parameters
5. Run analysis and review results

## Example Configuration

```yaml
system:
  name: "Production Line"
  components:
    - name: "Pump A"
      mtbf: 8760
      distribution: "weibull"
      beta: 2.5
    - name: "Pump B" 
      mtbf: 8760
      distribution: "weibull"
      beta: 2.5
  configuration: "parallel"
```
