# AeROS® - Asset Reliability and Operations Simulation

AeROS® is an advanced Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM) analysis tool specifically designed for heavy asset industries with specialized features for realistic simulations.

## Overview

The heavy asset industry is defined by extremely high-value production, incredibly harsh operating environments, severe safety risks, and massive capital investments. Unplanned downtime can cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per day. RAM analysis is not just an engineering exercise here; it's a critical business and risk management tool.

## Key Applications

### System Design Comparison During FEED
- Compare different system architectures during Front-End Engineering Design
- Evaluate trade-offs between reliability, cost, and performance
- Make informed decisions early in the project lifecycle

### Identifying Bottlenecks Early
- Pinpoint potential system bottlenecks before construction
- Analyze impact of component failures on overall system performance
- Optimize system design for maximum throughput

### Setting Realistic Performance Targets
- Establish achievable availability and reliability targets
- Balance performance goals with economic constraints
- Provide data-driven justification for design decisions

### Optimizing Maintenance Strategies
- Model different maintenance approaches (preventive, predictive, corrective)
- Optimize maintenance intervals and resource allocation
- Minimize total cost of ownership while maintaining reliability

### Managing Spare Parts Inventory
- Determine optimal spare parts inventory levels
- Balance carrying costs with availability requirements
- Model spare parts consumption patterns

### Debottlenecking Production
- Identify and eliminate production bottlenecks
- Analyze impact of equipment upgrades
- Optimize production schedules and maintenance windows

## Advanced Features

### Reliability Block Diagrams
Create complex system models with:
- Series and parallel configurations
- K-out-of-N redundancy
- Sub-diagram hierarchies
- Complex logical constructs

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Advanced simulation engine for accurate predictions
- Statistical confidence in results
- Sensitivity analysis capabilities
- What-if scenario modeling

### Redundant Resource Manager
Model complex standby scenarios including:
- Hot, warm, and cold standby systems
- Shared spare equipment pools
- Complex switching logic
- Resource allocation strategies

### Life-Stress Models
Analyze production rate impacts using:
- Cumulative damage theory
- Variable operating conditions
- Stress-dependent failure rates
- Realistic operational profiles

### Specialized Plots
- **System Availability**: Track availability over time
- **System Flowrate**: Monitor production capacity
- **Spare Availability**: Analyze spare parts performance
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identify critical parameters

## Getting Started with AeROS®

### Installation
1. Download AeROS® from the [download page](/download)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Activate your license
4. Complete the initial configuration

### Your First RAM Analysis
1. **Create New Project**: Start with a project template
2. **Build System Model**: Use drag-and-drop interface to create RBD
3. **Define Components**: Set failure rates and maintenance parameters
4. **Configure Simulation**: Set simulation parameters and run conditions
5. **Analyze Results**: Review availability, reliability, and maintainability metrics

### Best Practices
- Start with simple models and add complexity gradually
- Validate models against historical data when available
- Use sensitivity analysis to identify critical components
- Document assumptions and data sources
- Regular model updates as new data becomes available

## Code Example: API Integration

```python
import aeros_api

# Initialize AeROS connection
client = aeros_api.Client(api_key="your_api_key")

# Create new RAM analysis project
project = client.create_project(
    name="Offshore Platform RAM Analysis",
    description="Reliability analysis for offshore oil platform"
)

# Define system components
compressor = project.add_component(
    name="Gas Compressor",
    failure_rate=0.0001,  # failures per hour
    repair_time=24,       # hours
    maintenance_interval=8760  # hours (annual)
)

# Build reliability block diagram
system = project.create_rbd()
system.add_series([compressor])

# Run Monte Carlo simulation
results = project.run_simulation(
    duration=8760,  # one year
    iterations=10000
)

print(f"System Availability: {results.availability:.4f}")
print(f"Mean Time to Failure: {results.mttf:.2f} hours")
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Failure Distributions
```python
# Define custom Weibull distribution
weibull_dist = aeros_api.WeibullDistribution(
    shape=2.5,
    scale=1000,
    location=0
)

component.set_failure_distribution(weibull_dist)
```

### Maintenance Modeling
```python
# Configure preventive maintenance
maintenance = aeros_api.PreventiveMaintenance(
    interval=720,  # hours
    duration=4,    # hours
    effectiveness=0.95  # restoration factor
)

component.add_maintenance(maintenance)
```
